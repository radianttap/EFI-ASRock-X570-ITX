### WiFI / Bt

The combo below offers natively supported WiFi 5 / Bluetooth 4.

- 1750Mbps Dual Band WiFi 2.4GHz/5GHz / Bluetooth 4.0 [Broadcom BCM94360CD](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1750Mbps-Dual-Band-WiFi-Bluetooth-Card-2-4GHz-5GHz-BT-4-0-Broadcom-BCM94360CD-Wireless-Module/32974196141.html) card

Combined with this riser cable, the card/adapter combo from above can be moved outside the motherboard I/O shroud, instead of existing Intel AX200 card.

- Mini [PCIe riser with adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/BCM94360CD-BCM94360CS2-BCM943224PCIEBT2-Card-To-M-2-Key-A-E-Cable-For-Mac-OS-and-and/4000286967003.html) for M.2 Key A/E

### BIOS

Version 3.20

- Fast Boot: `Disabled`
- CSM: `Disabled`
- Above 4G Decoding: `Enabled`
- Resizable Bar Support: `Enabled`
- PCIe speed: `Gen 3` (*do not* leave it on Auto)
- XMP Profile activated.
- FCLK set to 1600MHz, to be equal to MCLK.

## Usage

1. [Update `PlatformInfo/Generic` stuff](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) with your own, inside `config.plist`
2. Use your Ethernet‚Äôs MAC address for `ROM` value, as explained in the Dortania guide. Don‚Äôt leave it as all 0s.
3. Update value of `brcmfx-country` argument in `NVRAM/7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82/boot-args` with your country code. Should be identical or compatible with what your WiFi router is broadcasting. (Remove the parameter if you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about here.)
4. Turn off Power Nap in Energy Saver.

### What‚Äôs working

Pretty much everything.

- NVMe SSD recognised out of the box.
- WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
- All USB ports properly mapped.
- Radeon GPU, natively supported.
- 4K HDMI with HDR, Dolby.
- Watch unlock, Handoff, iMessage, iCloud, Keychain, Xcode etc.
- System Integrity Protection (SIP) fully enabled.
- Sleep / Wake

#### Media & DRM

- If you add WhateverGreen.kext and `unfairgva` as [device property for GFX0](https://forum.amd-osx.com/index.php?threads/fixing-green-screen-drm-on-bigsur-for-appletv-and-apple-music-streaming.1476/), then everything works: Plex, Netflix in Safari, iTunes, Apple TV+ etc). All are fully hardware-accelerated.
- I have decided to exclude WEG and with that I am unable to run Netflix in Safari and TV+ content. It's not important to me for this particular build.


### What‚Äôs not working

- Sidecar
- Thunderbolt 3

## Notes

Use at your own risk. 

- All `.efi` drivers and `.kext` are `-RELEASE` builds from the respective packages. 
- OpenCanopy (GUI boot menu) is up and running.
- I don‚Äôt boot Windows 10 using OC, thus I can‚Äôt guarantee it will work. I have Win 10 installed on separate SSD and switch using Boot Menu.

**Don‚Äôt ask me for help.** Sorry but this stuff is finicky and infuriatingly detailed that every little mis-step can be a proper headache. This is why [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io) advises to not reuse anyone‚Äôs EFI.  

Ask [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/) and the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Wxam8aH).

Good luck.
